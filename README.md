# Process_scheduling
run different processes with different algorithms to see which is quickest. This uses shortest job first, round robin, priority, first come first serve, and round robin with priority. This uses two versions of the same BinaryTree files. A binaryTree that goes from least to greatest (shortest job first) and greatest to least (priority). I used my PCB class from the 1 million processes/readyqueue assignment.
